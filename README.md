# Anthonys-Portfolio

-----Initial Commit-----</br>
Contains the raw base 1st Draft of Anthony's Protfolio</br>
Links work properly, no projects have been completed to showcase work.</br>
Instead user is presented with an alert warning of the uncompleted work.</br>
"Projects to come to life" will be replaced with just "Projects" upon having a project to showcase</br>

Features to consider including:</br>
New Profile Picture</br>
More eye-appealing colors/details</br>
Consider different layout when all components are completed.</br>
Finish projects to come to life and add more ideas.</br>
Upon finishing projects asure that upon clicking the project it redirects users onto a new tab to view the project.</br>
Add your resume and upon clicking the nav item it redirects you to a new tab to view the pdf of my resume.</br>
