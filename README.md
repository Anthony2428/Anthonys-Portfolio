# Anthonys-Portfolio

-----Initial Commit-----
Contains the raw base 1st Draft of Anthony's Protfolio
Links work properly, no projects have been completed to showcase work.
Instead user is presented with an alert warning of the uncompleted work.
"Projects to come to life" will be replaced with just "Projects" upon having a project to showcase

Features to consider including:
New Profile Picture
More eye-appealing colors/details
Consider different layout when all components are completed.
Finish projects to come to life and add more ideas.
Upon finishing projects asure that upon clicking the project it redirects users onto a new tab to view the project.
Add your resume and upon clicking the nav item it redirects you to a new tab to view the pdf of my resume.
